# RubyMotion Samples

This repository contains a collection of RubyMotion examples.

## Requirements

* RubyMotion 5.7, Xcode 9.2 or greater (see http://www.rubymotion.com).

## Projects

Each one of the sub-directories in this repository is a genuine RubyMotion project that demonstrates one or more particular features of iOS, OS X, watchOS, tvOS or Android.

Check their `README` files to know more. Type `rake` from there to build and try the sample in the simulator. You can find the full source code from their `app` directory.

For instance, to try the iOS `Beer` sample:

```
$ cd ios/Beer
$ rake
```

If you have a sample to contribute, please create a pull request!
